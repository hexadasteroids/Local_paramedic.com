                <br>Pathophysiology: 
                Bleeding Typically occurs when the mucosa is eroded and vessels become exposed and Subsequently break

                The following precautions Should be imparted to the Patient : 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Use nasal Saline Spray
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sneeze with mouth open
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do not use nasal digital manipulation
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid aspirin</li>
                </ul>
                The following Simple instructions for self-treatment for nose bleeding should be provided:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Apply fim digital pressure for 5-10 minutes
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                Beware of these Common mistakes that may have dire consequences: 
                <ul id="four">
    <li>Returning the head back : This movement may result in swallowing blood wich not only leads to a feeling of need to vomit, but also make it difficult to estimate the amount of bleeding </li>
    <li>Sleeping: stretching the body during nosebleeds may lead to blood reaching the breathing Path which may have dangerous consequences</li>
    <li>Blocking the nose : putting tissues or cottons as a way to prevent blood from bleeds which leads to its imprisonment and increases its bleeding once the cotton is removed </li>
    <li>Cleaning the nose Vigorously after the bleeding Stops : The Strong movement of the nose during the first hours after the bleeding stops  increases the risk of it happening again,so it is better to be careful and deal very gently with the nose until 12 hours  have passed after the bleeding stops</li>
            </ul>
            Causes: 
The causes of the nose bleeding can be divided into local causes (eg, trauma, mucosal irritation, septal abnormality, inflammatory diseases ,tumors), systemic causes (eg, blood dyscrasias, artenosderosis, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) and idiopathic causes. Local trauma is the most common cause, followed by facial trauma , foreign bodies, nasal or Sinus infections and prolonged inhalation  of dry air. AIso, There is a relationship between  hypertension and  nosebleeding which is often misunderstood. Patient with nosebleeding commonly present with an elevated blood pressure . Nosebleeding is more Common in hypertensive patients, perhaps owing to vascular fragility from long-Standing disease.
